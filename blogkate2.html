                >(UPDATE: After writing this blog, on Friday 16/12/2022, DS37
                were tasked with updating one of their application vizzes. I
                chose to update my Final Viz. This blog now includes what I
                wanted to change on my Final application previous to my
                presentation, and what I actually changed. The changes will be
                in Bold Italics)</strong

            To start, I should have prepped and cleaned my data set before even
            attempting to visualise the data. This could have been done using
            Alteryx or Tableau Prep. In doing this, it would have saved a lot of
            time trying to figure out what certain measures were and in turn
            made my life a whole lot easier! One part that I struggled with was
            the field 'State Name' as originally it was abbreviated. After
            playing around with Tableau I managed to add a join in which changed
            the name to the Full state name, but what took me hours to do could
            have been an instant join if I had prepped my data! I also included
            a supplementary data set to show the sales profits of the leading
            chains, and again if I used a prep tool I would have saved myself a
            lot of time and effort!!
          </p>
          <p>
            The next change would be getting rid of the pie chart at the start
            of my Viz. I included both a pie chart, and a bar chart which the
            user could switch between. Looking back, this is a bit unnecessary
            and one would have sufficed. &nbsp;<em
              ><strong
                >Once the pie chart was removed, I added a header to show which
                bar was Independent Restaurants and which was Chain. Carl
                recommended that I then turn the chart to the side in order to
                make it a bit more appealing.</strong

            Another part of my Final Viz that I am not a fan of now is the
            amount of words I used. At the time, I was very eager to get my
            points across and to guide the user in finding the analysis. But, I
            have learned that less is more and that big chunks of text are harsh
            on the eye. Visually, I think I could have made the font a bit more
            interesting. I should have added some definition within my Titles,
            and used these to lead some of the analysis I was providing.
            <em
              ><strong
                >I cut down the amounts of words that I used on my Viz and made
                it a bit less explanatory. I also changed the font so that it
                was the same across my whole dashboard.</strong

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In my Viz, I included a moving reference line to show the 'Chainness
            Rate' (Percentage of Chain Restaurants per State) and the
            'Population' of said State. I think this worked really well and
            enabled the user to interact with the data. I should have included
            an average reference line so that the user could see if the selected
            state was above or below average.
            <em
              ><strong
                >I took this idea and added it into my scatterplot. There is now
                an average line for both Population and Chainness. One thing I
                think I could do further is to colour the different quadrants so
                that they change if the selected state is above or below the
                average for chainness/population.</strong

            Looking back, I think I should have changed my final Map, which
            shows the most popular cuisines of each County and the density of
            'Chainness' in each County, into something else. Or, I could have
            changed it so that the colours blended into each other more, as I
            don't think it gives an accurate portrayal as to the rates of
            'Chainness' in each county of the USA.

                to this map. I don't think the colour added anything to my
                dashboard and it was quite harsh on the eyes. In the end, I
                decided to change the map so that it showed the most popular
                restaurant type (Chain or Independent) for each county. This map
                looked a lot better and allowed me to include the most popular
                cuisine of that county in the tooltip also. Lorna recommended I
                split the chart into two so that we could see both the Chain and
                Independent Restaurants side by side!</strong

                I added an extra bar chart to show the Top 5 Counties in the USA
                that have the most varied cuisine type. This was split between
                Chain and Independent and I believe it could add a lot of
                interaction to my dashboard. A suggestion I had was to allow the
                user to select a county on the map and the chart would update
                accordingly.

            The last bit of my Final Dashboard that I would change is the
            conclusion. As mentioned before, my Viz is pretty wordy and I think
            my conclusion shows this the most. I could have used analysis more
            to conclude my points instead of a huge chunk of text. If it was
            more snappy and engaging then I feel the user would find it more
            enjoyable to interact with.
            <em
              ><strong
                >I decided to stick with my wordy conclusion as It summed up my
                analysis nicely. I did add a show/hide button to allow for a bit
                more space on my dashboard.</strong
